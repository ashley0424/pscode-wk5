// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


1. n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
2  n/2
3. n/2=n meaning if the result is the same as the n divided by 2 it is even
4. If the result is not the same as the n divided by 2 then it is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


1. Pick 5 different numbers
2. Add the 5 numbers listed in previous step together and divide by 5 to find the average
3. Print the smallest number from step 1 and the largest number from step 1
4. These steps above give the average of the 5 numbers from step 1 and also give the smallest number from step 1 and the largest number from step 1
